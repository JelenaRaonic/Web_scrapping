#### Part 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
Inspect the page to identify which elements to scrape. Extract the titles and preview text of the news articles that is scraped. Store the scraping results in Python data structures and store the scraped data in a JSON file.

#### Part 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data.
Inspect the page to identify which elements to scrape.Assemble the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame. The columns should have the same headings as the table on the website.Examine the data types that are currently associated with each column(when necessary convert).Analyze dataset by using Pandas functions to answer questions:

1.How many months exist on Mars?

2.How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?

3.What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)?

4.Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? 

5.How many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year?
